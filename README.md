### Design Choices

#### Colour Scheme
The colour scheme was carefully selected using a Contrast Checker https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/ to ensure accessibility and readability.
- #003459 Prussian blue was chosen as the primary colour, as it evokes a sense of depth and stability while complementing sky-themed imagery. After browsing gradients,
- #BDDEFF French Pass was selected for its excellent contrast ratio, creating a harmonious and visually appealing design that enhances both text and images.

#### Fonts
Google Fonts https://fonts.google.com/ was used to select the typography for the website, ensuring readability and visual appeal. 
- Zen Dots was chosen for H1 headings, giving a modern and dynamic look.
- Lexend, a sans-serif font with a strong readability rating, is used for body text to enhance the user experience. 
- Roboto was selected for H2 and H3 headings, providing a clean and professional appearance while maintaining consistency across the design.

#### Icons
Font Awesome https://fontawesome.com/ was used to select icons that visually reinforce their associated meanings. Each icon was carefully chosen to enhance user understanding and navigation. For example, a **map pin** icon was used for the address, as it is commonly associated with locations on maps. A **calendar icon** was selected to represent event dates, making it immediately clear and recognisable. These icons contribute to a more intuitive and user-friendly design.

#### Images/Videos
Images were carefully selected from Pixabay https://pixabay.com/ and Pexels https://www.pexels.com/ ensuring they were free to use and relevant to the theme. The chosen images showcase paragliders in action — some soaring through the sky, while others are preparing for takeoff. For event cards, breathtaking landscape images were selected to highlight the stunning locations participants can experience on our expeditions. Additionally, a video file featuring the view of paragliders taking off was included to enhance the immersive experience.

### Content
- https://openai.com/chatgpt/overview/ The content was written by me but was reviewed for spelling, grammar and consistency, and enhanced with the help of ChatGPT. Some sections were also translated and refined to improve readability. I also asked ChatGPT for FAQs about paragliding, and it provided the answers. Additionally, ChatGPT helped by providing information on the best places to paraglide and the reasons why they are ideal.

### Design
The design of this website was inspired by the Boardwalk Games tutorial from Code Institute. Some layout and styling solutions were adapted from the tutorial to fit the needs of this project.
Bootstrap navbar, a header with a Bootstrap carousel (I used a different one, but the concept of two columns on large devices and up was taken from the tutorial). The events page layout with cards and their styling was also inspired by the tutorial. The contact page, including the form code, was fully incorporated from the tutorial as it suited the project's needs.

## Code

- Bootstrap 5.3.x was used throughout the project to style and structure various elements, including the navbar, containers, carousel, buttons, link buttons, accordion, forms, and cards.
